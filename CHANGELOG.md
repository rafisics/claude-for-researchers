# Changelog

Notable, user-facing changes to this toolkit. This is a curated list of the
updates worth knowing about — not every commit (see the git history for that).
Useful for deciding whether to re-copy anything from `starter/` into a project
you set up from an earlier version.

Versioning is calendar-based (`vYYYY.MM`): this is a guide and a copy-in starter
pack, not a linked library, so there is no API to break — the version answers
"how current is my copy?", nothing more.

## v2026.06 — 2026-06-22 (update)

### Changed
- **`nb-to-wolfbook` now de-rectangles private-font operators (PUA → ASCII).** Mathematica
  stores `==`, `->`, `:>` and the constants `I`, `E` as characters in the Unicode Private Use
  Area. The kernel parses them exactly like the ASCII forms and Mathematica's own font draws
  them correctly, but a code font without those glyphs (VS Code's default, most monospace
  fonts) renders each as an **empty rectangle** — so a cell like `If[w == 1, …]` showed up as
  `If[w ▯ 1, …]`. Nothing was broken, but it was confusing to read. Conversion and `--fix-wb`
  now normalize these to ASCII automatically (string-literal-aware — text inside `"..."` is
  left alone — and word-boundary-safe for the letter constants). New `--puafix` CLI does only
  this de-rectangling on an existing `.wb` with the smallest possible diff, and `--check` now
  also reports any rectangle-rendering PUA characters left in code cells. **Re-copy
  `starter/.claude/skills/nb-to-wolfbook/` to pick this up.**
- **Wolfram output now wraps instead of forcing a sideways scroll.** `notebook.output.wordWrap`
  (already shipped) only wraps *text* output; a Wolfram result renders by default as a single
  fixed-width *image* that can only scroll horizontally, so wide results still ran off the right
  edge. The starter settings and `scripts/apply-notebook-ux.py` now also set
  `wolfbook.notebook.rendering.outputFormat` to `"InputForm"`, which renders results as wrapping
  plain text that follows the notebook width and one theme colour. (Trade-off: linear text loses
  the 2-D typeset layout — set a notebook back to `"Image"` if you prefer that there. The key is
  Wolfbook-specific and harmless to non-Wolfbook notebooks.) See
  [`docs/wolfbook-notebook-ux.md`](docs/wolfbook-notebook-ux.md).

### Action needed if you set up a project before this release
- **To get output wrapping, re-copy `starter/.vscode/settings.json`** (or add the one line
  `"wolfbook.notebook.rendering.outputFormat": "InputForm"`), or re-run
  `python3 scripts/apply-notebook-ux.py`. Optional — nothing breaks without it; wide Wolfram
  output just keeps scrolling sideways until you do. Reload the VS Code window afterwards.

## v2026.06 — 2026-06-20 (update)

### Added
- **Notebook word wrap + Mathematica-style section folding for VS Code.** Two quality-of-life
  fixes for working in `.wb` (and any) notebooks: long cell lines now *wrap* instead of
  scrolling sideways, and you can *collapse a whole section* the way you double-click a section
  bracket in Mathematica. Neither patches the Wolfbook extension — both configure VS Code
  itself, so they survive extension updates. The non-obvious part the new guide explains:
  wrapping notebook *cells only* (without also wrapping your `.tex`/`.py`/`.md` files) needs
  `notebook.editorOptionsCustomizations` — the plain `editor.wordWrap` wraps every file, and the
  language-scoped `"[wolfram]"` form doesn't reach cells at all. Word wrap now ships on by
  default in the starter (`starter/.vscode/settings.json`); the new
  `scripts/apply-notebook-ux.py` installer also adds the section-folding keybindings
  (`Ctrl+Alt+[`/`]`, mac `⌥⌘[`/`]`), works across VS Code / Cursor / VSCodium / Windsurf, and
  is idempotent with `--dry-run`/`--revert`. Both bootstrap routes install it for
  Mathematica/notebook projects (a manual copy of all of `starter/` still gets it regardless).
  See [`docs/wolfbook-notebook-ux.md`](docs/wolfbook-notebook-ux.md).

### Action needed if you set up a project before this release
- **To get word wrap as a tracked default, re-copy `starter/.gitignore` (or just add the two
  lines).** Its `.vscode/` rule is now `.vscode/*` + `!.vscode/settings.json`, so the shared
  word-wrap `settings.json` is tracked while personal VS Code state stays ignored. Then copy
  `starter/.vscode/settings.json` into your project's `.vscode/`, or run
  `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mexregkan/claude-for-researchers/main/scripts/apply-notebook-ux.py | python3 -`
  (which also installs the section-folding keybindings). This is optional — nothing breaks
  without it; you just won't get word wrap until you do one of these.

## v2026.06 — 2026-06-18 (update)

### Fixed
- **`verify-citation`, `reality-check`, `cross-validate` were missing their YAML frontmatter.**
  Without the `---\nname: ...\ndescription: ...\n---` block, Claude Code silently does not
  register these as slash commands — `/verify-citation` would not appear in the `/` menu and
  could not be invoked. Re-copy all three `SKILL.md` files from `starter/.claude/skills/`.

### Changed
- **`cross-validate` example generalised.** The Step 1 worked example used an Eisenstein series
  claim that was specific to one project. Replaced with a universally recognisable Gaussian
  integral example so the format is clear to any researcher.

---

## v2026.06 — 2026-06-13

First tagged release of the current structure. Everything below landed this month.

### Action needed if you set up a project before this release
- **Skills must use the folder format `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.** A flat
  `skills/<name>.md` file is silently *not* registered as a slash command. If your
  skills are flat files, move each `<name>.md` to `<name>/SKILL.md`.
- The skills below were rewritten. If you copied earlier versions, re-copy them
  from `starter/.claude/skills/` to get the fixes.
- **Re-copy `nb-to-wolfbook` and `sync-wb-nb`** (see the `nb-to-wolfbook` entry under
  Fixed): an earlier copy can *silently drop a factor* from a display-wrapped
  definition during `.nb` → `.wb` conversion. Re-copy both skill folders from
  `starter/.claude/skills/`; if you installed `sync-wb-nb` globally, also replace
  `~/.claude/skills/sync-wb-nb/`. Then run
  `python3 .claude/skills/nb-to-wolfbook/wl_normalize.py --check <your.wb>` on existing
  notebooks — the gap was latent, so a notebook converted earlier may already be wrong.
- **Re-copy `latex-compile`** (see Changed): an earlier copy missed broken `\ref`/`\cite`
  warnings, so a compile could report clean while the PDF printed `??`/`[?]`. Re-copy
  `latex-compile` from `starter/.claude/skills/` (and replace `~/.claude/skills/latex-compile/`
  if you installed it globally), then recompile and confirm the broken-ref gate is clean.

### Added
- **Adaptive bootstrapping.** Both setup routes now install *by relevance* instead
  of installing everything: the README bootstrap prompt selects skills from your
  project description, and a new interactive `scripts/bootstrap.sh` asks a few
  questions and installs only what applies. The workbook / brief /
  next-session-prompts trio plus CLAUDE.md is the universal core; everything else
  is conditional.
- **Global skills** (`~/.claude/skills/`) documented — install a skill once and use
  it in every project; bootstrapping checks there before making a local copy.
- **Overleaf-via-git workflow** and the `overleaf-sync` skill, for collaborating on
  a shared Overleaf project from its git remote.
- **AI-output staging**: `numerics/generated/` and `figures/generated/` folders for
  Claude-produced outputs pending your review.
- **Wolfbook splitter fix**: `scripts/patch-wolfbook-splitter.py` patches a sharp edge in
  Wolfbook's cell evaluator — a `(* ... *)` comment right after an operator (`x :=(*note*)`
  with the RHS on the next line) hid the operator from the line-splitter, tearing one
  statement into two broken inputs (`Syntax::sntxi` + a bogus orphan evaluation). Idempotent,
  backs up, `--revert`able. Both bootstrap routes surface a zero-clone one-line installer
  (`curl … | python3 -`) for Mathematica projects. See
  [`docs/wolfbook-comment-split-fix.md`](docs/wolfbook-comment-split-fix.md).
- **Context-monitoring note** in the session-length section: the read-only `/context`
  (what's filling the window) and `/usage` (where tokens/cost go) commands, plus a rule
  of thumb — glance at ~50%, act by ~70%, don't wait for auto-compaction, and for
  research prefer a fresh session seeded from your documents over repeated (lossy)
  compaction.
- **`wolfram-headless` skill** for reliable heavy headless `wolframscript`. It encodes
  two hard-won lessons: (1) `The product exited because of a license error` is almost
  always a mis-reported kernel **crash** (a memory spike), not a licensing problem — so
  it shows how to confirm the licence then shrink the computation; and (2) literal Greek
  in a `.wls` file **silently corrupts symbols** under `wolframscript`'s non-UTF-8 read,
  so always use ASCII escapes (`\[Omega]` …). Ships `scripts/greek2esc.py` (convert a
  file in one pass) and an opt-in `hooks/wolfram-license-notice.sh` that auto-flags the
  misleading error. `scripts/bootstrap.sh` installs it for Mathematica/wolframscript
  projects (and now fetches every skill's helper scripts, not just the SKILL.md).

### Changed
- **`latex-compile`** rewritten: compiles with `pdflatex` and captures stdout
  (avoiding the `latexmk` stale-log trap), greps with `-a` (pdflatex embeds binary
  bytes that silently defeat plain grep), uses correct severity thresholds, and
  reformats rather than rewords when fixing overfull boxes.
- **`latex-compile` now catches broken `\ref`/`\cite`.** The issue grep matched only
  capital `Undefined` (the fatal *control sequence* error) and so missed the lowercase
  broken-reference/citation *warnings* (`Reference 'x' … undefined`, `Citation 'x' …
  undefined`) — meaning a dead `\ref` could ship as `??` and a dead `\cite` as `[?]`
  while the run reported clean. The pattern is now `[Uu]ndefined`, plus key-mismatch
  diagnosis (used vs. defined keys) and a **mandatory broken-ref gate** that must report
  zero undefined refs/cites before the skill claims success.
- **`sync-wb-nb`** gained a `regenerate` mode that rebuilds a whole `.nb` from its
  `.wb` with proper syntax colouring and section headings — for new or
  fully-rewritten notebooks, alongside the existing cell-by-cell sync.
- **`nb-to-wolfbook`** rewritten to make every converted cell *bridge-safe*: each
  statement goes on one physical line, so the tool that runs cells from VS Code
  cannot silently mis-evaluate a statement that was wrapped across several lines.
  The line-boundary detector handles the tricky Wolfram cases — postfix `&`
  (`Function`) ends a statement while `&&` continues it, `/;` (`Condition`) and `/.`
  continue, `2.` (a number) ends, and backslash-continued long numbers/strings
  (e.g. high-precision values, `*^-76` exponents) re-join with no inserted space.
  Ships helper scripts (`nb2wb.py`, `nb2wb_extract.wls`, `wl_normalize.py`).
- **Permissions model** in `starter/.claude/settings.json`: allow routine commands,
  *ask* before anything dangerous (including `sudo`/`mkfs`/`fdisk`/`shred`), block
  nothing outright — so Claude never stalls but always pauses before a risky action.
- Templates consolidated into `starter/` (the old `examples/` folder was retired);
  the `sync-condensed` skill was renamed `sync-brief`.
- The **dual-remote mirror hook is now opt-in** (off by default). It was a silent
  trap before — see Fixed.

### Fixed
- **`nb-to-wolfbook` could silently drop a factor from a display-wrapped definition.**
  The bridge-safety detector decided line breaks by how a line *ended*. A wide
  definition that the Mathematica front end *display-wrapped* onto an indented next
  line ends in a complete value (e.g. `…)`), so the detector mistook the wrap for a
  statement boundary, split the definition, and silently dropped the trailing factor —
  no error, a wrong definition. `wl_normalize` now also treats a newline followed by a
  *continuation indent* as a wrap (genuine statement breaks start at column 0), and
  ships a hazard checker — `wl_normalize.py --check <file.wb>` (exit 1 on any
  definition split across a top-level newline), run automatically by `nb2wb.py` and by
  `sync-wb-nb regenerate` before it overwrites a `.nb`.
- **Silent dual-remote mirror hook.** The starter's `settings.json` shipped an
  *active* `PostToolUse` hook running `scripts/git-push-both.sh`, but the starter
  didn't include that script — so a copied project appeared to mirror pushes to a
  second remote (e.g. institution GitLab) while silently doing nothing. The hook now
  ships **off** (empty `PostToolUse`), the `git-push-both.sh` template is included
  under `starter/scripts/`, and both bootstrap routes enable it only if you say you
  use two remotes, with the exact block to paste documented in `settings.json`.

### Clarified
- The opening of the guide now states its scope explicitly: this is a workspace and
  workflow toolkit to make *your* research faster, not a system for getting Claude
  to conduct research autonomously.
