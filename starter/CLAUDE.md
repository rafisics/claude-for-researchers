# CLAUDE.md — [Project Name]

<!--
INSTRUCTIONS FOR FILLING THIS IN:
- Fill in every section. Don't leave placeholders.
- Keep it to one screenful per section where possible.
- Update "Current status" and "Open tasks" at the end of every session.
- Move finished items out of "Open tasks" into next-session-prompts.md (DONE log).
- Do NOT use this file as a logbook. It is a current-state snapshot.
-->

## Goal
<!-- One paragraph. What is this project? What is the mathematical/scientific object?
     What is the open question you are working toward? -->

[e.g., Compute the integral of four modular Eisenstein series over the fundamental
domain as a function of their spectral parameters, using the Rankin–Selberg unfolding method.]

## Files
<!-- Map of every file Claude needs to know about. One line each.
     Be explicit about which file is authoritative. -->

- **brief.tex** — short (20–30 pp) self-contained reference; READ FIRST in every new session.
  Contains current results, key formulas, open questions. No derivations.
- **workbook.tex** — full working record (~N pp): every proof, derivation, failed attempt,
  and discussion in complete detail. Not a paper draft — a research journal in LaTeX.
  Too large to read in full — grep or search by section label.
- **next-session-prompts.md** — task log. Top section = next task; bottom = DONE log.
- **numerics/** — computation scripts. `README.md` inside explains each file.

## Conventions
<!-- Notation Claude must get right. Be precise about signs, normalizations, definitions. -->

- [e.g., ξ(s) = π^{-s/2} Γ(s/2) ζ(s). Functional equation ξ(s) = ξ(1-s).]
- [e.g., E*_s = ξ(2s) E(z,s) = completed Eisenstein series. Simple poles at s=0,1, residues ∓½.]
- [Add your own conventions here]

## Current status
<!-- One screenful. What is established? What is the last result? What is the exact next step?
     Update this before ending every session. -->

**Last result (DATE):** [what was computed/proved]

**Established:**
- [bullet list of what is rigorous and complete]

**Open:**
- [bullet list of what is pending, ranked by priority]

**Next step:** [the single most important thing to do next]

## Chat formatting (IMPORTANT)
In chat replies, do NOT use LaTeX markup ($...$, \frac, \xi, etc.) — it does not
render in Claude Code's chat window. Write math in plain Unicode:
  ξ, μ, σ, Γ, ζ, ∑, ∏, ∫, √, ½, →, ≈, ≠, ≤, ⇒
  single subscripts/superscripts (one char): M₃, μ₀, sᵢ, x², yⁿ
  multi-char sub/superscripts: M_{ab}, e^{-π t}, τ^{-2}
LaTeX belongs ONLY inside .tex files.

## Citations (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
<!-- Prevents fabricated references. Claude invents citations with full confidence. -->

Never write a citation into any file without first verifying the paper exists on
Semantic Scholar, arXiv, or OpenAlex. Use `/verify-citation` before adding any
reference. If you cannot confirm the paper exists, say so explicitly — do not
invent a plausible alternative.

## Anti-sycophancy rule (IMPORTANT)
<!-- Makes capitulation visible. Claude will agree when it should not. -->

If you change your answer because I expressed doubt or disagreement, say so
explicitly: "I am revising my earlier answer because you pushed back."
Do not silently update a formula or sign without flagging the change.

## AI-generated outputs
<!-- Separates what you computed from what Claude computed. -->

All plots, tables, and numerical outputs you produce go in `numerics/generated/`
or `figures/generated/` until I have reviewed them and traced them to a committed
script. Never include `generated/` content in workbook.tex without my explicit instruction.

## Skills
<!-- List skills defined in .claude/skills/ and when to invoke them. -->

- `/latex-compile` — compile workbook.tex or brief.tex, fix errors and overfull boxes.
  Use after any edit to a .tex file.
- `/sync-condensed` — propagate load-bearing changes from workbook.tex to brief.tex.
  Use after establishing a new result.
- `/nb-to-wolfbook` — convert .nb notebooks or .m scripts to Wolfbook's .wb format.
  Use when migrating existing Mathematica files to work in VS Code with Wolfbook.
- `/verify-citation` — verify a paper exists before writing it as a citation.
- `/reality-check` — re-derive a contested result in isolation to detect sycophancy.
- `/cross-validate` — format a physics claim for cross-model validation.

## Writing style in workbook.tex (IMPORTANT)
<!-- Tell Claude how detailed to be when writing in your main document.
     Researchers often want very different levels of detail than Claude's default. -->

workbook.tex is the AUTHORITATIVE, COMPREHENSIVE record. Show every step of every
calculation. State each substitution, each application of the functional equation,
each sign. Never collapse multi-step manipulations into "one finds" or "a short
computation gives." If in doubt, over-explain.

[Adapt this section to your own preference — some researchers want the opposite:
 terse, theorem-style prose. Be explicit either way.]

## Numerics
<!-- Primary computation engine, venv location, any gotchas. -->

- Primary engine: Python + mpmath (precision: `mp.dps = 30` unless stated otherwise)
- venv: `numerics/venv/` — run scripts as `numerics/venv/bin/python numerics/script.py`
- Route all long-running output to `numerics/run.log`

## Git
<!-- Remote setup, identity, push procedure. -->

- Remote `github`: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git (primary)
- Remote `gitlab`: git@git.YOUR_INSTITUTION.ac.uk:YOUR_ID/YOUR_REPO.git (institution mirror)
- Push: `git push github main` (hook auto-mirrors to gitlab)
- Commit author: YOUR_NAME <your-email@example.com>
- NO Co-Authored-By trailers in commits.

## LaTeX gotchas
<!-- Any project-specific LaTeX issues Claude should know about. -->

- `\Res` is defined as `\DeclareRobustCommand` (used in section titles → .toc)
- Macros in use: [list your custom macros]
- Compile: `pdflatex workbook.tex` twice (for TOC), or `latexmk -pdf`
