# Notebook UX: word wrap + Mathematica-style section folding

**Who needs this:** anyone working in VS Code notebooks — primarily
[Wolfbook](https://wolfbook.app/) `.wb` notebooks (see the *Wolfbook* section of the main
README), but both features apply to any VS Code notebook (Jupyter included). Neither is a
patch to the Wolfbook extension; both configure VS Code itself, so they survive extension
updates.

It fixes two everyday annoyances:

1. **Long lines scroll sideways** instead of wrapping. You drag the cell right just to read
   the end of a line.
2. **No easy way to collapse a section.** In Mathematica you double-click a section bracket
   to fold a whole group away; in a VS Code notebook that affordance is easy to miss.

## Feature 1 — word wrap inside cells

### The catch

There are two natural-looking settings, and **both are wrong**. The language-scoped form does
nothing to cells:

```jsonc
// Looks right. Does NOT reach notebook cell editors (a VS Code limitation).
"[wolfram]": { "editor.wordWrap": "on" }
```

and the plain unscoped form works but wraps **every file you open** — your `.tex`, `.py`, and
`.md` included, which you probably don't want:

```jsonc
// Works, but wraps ALL editors, not just notebooks.
"editor.wordWrap": "on"
```

The right key applies editor options to notebook **cell editors only**:

```jsonc
"notebook.editorOptionsCustomizations": { "editor.wordWrap": "on" },
"notebook.output.wordWrap": true
```

(`notebook.output.wordWrap` wraps long *output* lines too.) These ship on by default in the
starter package's [`starter/.vscode/settings.json`](../starter/.vscode/settings.json), so a
project set up from the starter wraps its notebook cells — and nothing else — with no extra
step.

### Where to put it

- **Project-scoped (recommended):** `<project>/.vscode/settings.json` — wraps notebook cells
  in that project only. This is what the starter ships.
- **Global:** your user `settings.json` — wraps notebook cells everywhere.

After saving, reload the window (`Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Developer: Reload Window") so the
cell editors re-read the option.

## Feature 2 — collapse sections like Mathematica

This one needs **nothing built** — VS Code notebooks already fold markdown sections. A
markdown heading cell (`#`, `##`, `###`, `####`) gets a fold chevron in its left gutter;
folding it hides every cell beneath it down to the next heading of equal-or-higher level,
and it nests exactly like Section › Subsection › Subsubsection. The only reason it feels
missing is that the chevron is small and only shows on hover.

So this feature is just **ergonomic keybindings** — the keyboard twin of clicking that
chevron:

```jsonc
{ "key": "ctrl+alt+[", "mac": "alt+cmd+[", "command": "notebook.fold",   "when": "notebookEditorFocused && !inputFocus" },
{ "key": "ctrl+alt+]", "mac": "alt+cmd+]", "command": "notebook.unfold", "when": "notebookEditorFocused && !inputFocus" }
```

Select a cell (click its left margin, or press `Esc` to leave edit mode), then `Ctrl+Alt+[`
(mac `⌥⌘[`) collapses the section and `Ctrl+Alt+]` (mac `⌥⌘]`) expands it. The `when` clause
keeps the keys inactive while you are editing a cell, so they never clash with normal typing
or with code folding *inside* a cell (Wolfbook provides its own bracket/comment folding for
that). Keybindings are user-global only — VS Code has no per-project keybindings — which is
why these are not a starter file; the guard makes them safe to set globally.

**One caveat for existing notebooks:** only real markdown cells fold. If a heading was saved
as a code cell with markdown styling (Wolfbook occasionally does this for a Title cell), it
won't show a chevron. Convert it to a markdown cell and it folds like the rest.

## Install

Manual (copy-paste each snippet above into the matching file) works fine. The script just
does it for you across every installed VS Code / Cursor / VSCodium / Windsurf:

```sh
python3 scripts/apply-notebook-ux.py            # word wrap -> ./.vscode/settings.json ; folding -> user keybindings
python3 scripts/apply-notebook-ux.py --project /path/to/project   # word wrap into that project
python3 scripts/apply-notebook-ux.py --user-wrap                  # ALSO put word wrap in user (global) settings
python3 scripts/apply-notebook-ux.py --dry-run                    # preview, write nothing
python3 scripts/apply-notebook-ux.py --revert                     # undo (restores every .cfr-ux.bak)
```

If you set the project up with the bootstrap (and never cloned this repo), run it straight
from GitHub instead — no file to download:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mexregkan/claude-for-researchers/main/scripts/apply-notebook-ux.py | python3 -
# add --dry-run to preview first, or --revert to undo
```

The script:

- finds every VS Code-family user config dir (macOS / Linux / Windows paths);
- reads JSONC tolerantly (comments and trailing commas are fine, strings are respected);
- is **idempotent** — re-running adds nothing and never double-binds a key;
- backs up each file to `<file>.cfr-ux.bak` before its first change, and `--revert` restores
  it. (When merging into an existing config the file is re-serialised as plain JSON, so its
  comments are dropped — the backup keeps the original verbatim.)

Then reload the VS Code window.
