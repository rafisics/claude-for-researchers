# CLAUDE.md — [Project Name]

<!--
INSTRUCTIONS FOR FILLING THIS IN:
- Fill in every section. Don't leave placeholders.
- Keep it to one screenful per section where possible.
- Update "Current status" and "Open tasks" at the end of every session.
- Move finished items out of "Open tasks" into next-session-prompts.md (DONE log).
- Do NOT use this file as a logbook. It is a current-state snapshot.
-->

## Goal
<!-- One paragraph. What is this project? What is the mathematical/scientific object?
     What is the open question you are working toward? -->

[e.g., Compute the integral of four modular Eisenstein series over the fundamental
domain as a function of their spectral parameters, using the Rankin–Selberg unfolding method.]

## Files
<!-- Map of every file Claude needs to know about. One line each.
     Be explicit about which file is authoritative. -->

- **condensed.tex** — short (20–30 pp) self-contained reference; READ FIRST in every new session.
  Contains current results, key formulas, open questions. No derivations.
- **main.tex** — full paper draft (~N pp). Authoritative record; everything established in detail.
  Too large to read in full — grep or search by section label.
- **next-session-prompts.md** — task log. Top section = next task; bottom = DONE log.
- **numerics/** — computation scripts. `README.md` inside explains each file.

## Conventions
<!-- Notation Claude must get right. Be precise about signs, normalizations, definitions. -->

- [e.g., ξ(s) = π^{-s/2} Γ(s/2) ζ(s). Functional equation ξ(s) = ξ(1-s).]
- [e.g., E*_s = ξ(2s) E(z,s) = completed Eisenstein series. Simple poles at s=0,1, residues ∓½.]
- [Add your own conventions here]

## Current status
<!-- One screenful. What is established? What is the last result? What is the exact next step?
     Update this before ending every session. -->

**Last result (DATE):** [what was computed/proved]

**Established:**
- [bullet list of what is rigorous and complete]

**Open:**
- [bullet list of what is pending, ranked by priority]

**Next step:** [the single most important thing to do next]

## Chat formatting (IMPORTANT)
In chat replies, do NOT use LaTeX markup ($...$, \frac, \xi, etc.) — it does not
render in Claude Code's chat window. Write math in plain Unicode:
  ξ, μ, σ, Γ, ζ, ∑, ∏, ∫, √, ½, →, ≈, ≠, ≤, ⇒
  single subscripts/superscripts (one char): M₃, μ₀, sᵢ, x², yⁿ
  multi-char sub/superscripts: M_{ab}, e^{-π t}, τ^{-2}
LaTeX belongs ONLY inside .tex files.

## Skills
<!-- List skills defined in .claude/skills/ and when to invoke them. -->

- `/latex-compile` — compile main.tex or condensed.tex, fix errors and overfull boxes.
  Use after any edit to a .tex file.
- `/sync-condensed` — propagate load-bearing changes from main.tex to condensed.tex.
  Use after establishing a new result.
- `/nb-to-wolfbook` — convert .nb notebooks or .m scripts to Wolfbook's .wb format.
  Use when migrating existing Mathematica files to work in VS Code with Wolfbook.

## Writing style in main.tex (IMPORTANT)
<!-- Tell Claude how detailed to be when writing in your main document.
     Researchers often want very different levels of detail than Claude's default. -->

main.tex is the AUTHORITATIVE, COMPREHENSIVE record. Show every step of every
calculation. State each substitution, each application of the functional equation,
each sign. Never collapse multi-step manipulations into "one finds" or "a short
computation gives." If in doubt, over-explain.

[Adapt this section to your own preference — some researchers want the opposite:
 terse, theorem-style prose. Be explicit either way.]

## Structure and cross-references in main.tex (IMPORTANT)
<!-- Claude navigates main.tex with grep and targeted reads, not by reading top to bottom.
     These rules make that navigation reliable. -->

- Use \label on every section, subsection, theorem, proposition, equation, and figure.
  Cross-reference explicitly with \ref / \eqref. More cross-references than you would
  write for a human reader is the right amount.
- Maintain a clear section hierarchy (sections → subsections → subsubsections with
  meaningful names). Flat structure makes targeted reads unreliable.

## Corrections in main.tex (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
<!-- This rule prevents Claude from working from wrong information in future sessions. -->

If something in main.tex is discovered to be wrong, REPLACE IT IN PLACE. Do not
append a correction paragraph later ("earlier I claimed X, but actually Y").

Reason: Claude reads different parts of main.tex in each session. If the wrong
version stays in the file and the correction is only further down, Claude may read
the wrong statement in a later session and never see the correction. It will then
work from incorrect information, confidently.

## Numerics
<!-- Primary computation engine, venv location, any gotchas. -->

- Primary engine: Python + mpmath (precision: `mp.dps = 30` unless stated otherwise)
- venv: `numerics/venv/` — run scripts as `numerics/venv/bin/python numerics/script.py`
- Route all long-running output to `numerics/run.log`

## Git
<!-- Remote setup, identity, push procedure. -->

- Remote `github`: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git (primary)
- Remote `gitlab`: git@git.YOUR_INSTITUTION.ac.uk:YOUR_ID/YOUR_REPO.git (institution mirror)
- Push: `git push github main` (hook auto-mirrors to gitlab)
- Commit author: YOUR_NAME <your-email@example.com>
- NO Co-Authored-By trailers in commits.

## LaTeX gotchas
<!-- Any project-specific LaTeX issues Claude should know about. -->

- `\Res` is defined as `\DeclareRobustCommand` (used in section titles → .toc)
- Macros in use: [list your custom macros]
- Compile: `pdflatex main.tex` twice (for TOC), or `latexmk -pdf`
