# Guide: The Condensed Notes Document

The condensed notes document solves a specific problem: your main document grows
too large for Claude to hold in context, but Claude needs to understand your
project accurately to help you. The condensed document is what Claude reads at
the start of new sessions instead of the full document.

---

## What it is

A SHORT (15–30 pages / 1000–3000 lines), SELF-CONTAINED reference document.
It contains the current state of the project — theorems, key formulas, results,
open questions — without proofs, derivations, or history.

It is NOT a summary of the main document. It is a COMPRESSED KNOWLEDGE BASE
that a reader (or Claude) could use to understand the current state of the
project from scratch, without reading anything else.

## What to include

**YES — include these:**
- Every established theorem and proposition, stated precisely (without proof)
- Every key formula, with the exact normalizations and signs you use
- The current status: what is proved, what is conjectured, what is open
- Open problems, ranked by importance
- Notational conventions (what every symbol means)
- Cross-references to the main document (section labels, equation names)
  so Claude can navigate there when needed
- Recent corrections: if you found an error and fixed it, the corrected
  statement — with a note that the old version was wrong

**NO — exclude these:**
- Proofs and derivations (these are in the main document)
- Pedagogical examples and motivation
- History of how you arrived at results
- "We will see in §X that..." forward references
- In-progress work or speculative ideas (these belong in next-session-prompts)
- Anything that is not yet established

## Structure

A structure that works well for mathematical research:

```
§1 Abstract / main results
   — The 2-3 key theorems stated precisely. Someone reading only this
     section should know what the paper proves.

§2 Conventions and definitions
   — Every symbol defined. Normalizations stated. This section prevents
     Claude from getting confused about which convention you use.

§3-N Results by topic
   — Each section = one topic. Theorem, formula, key data.
     Reference to main document for proof.
     Mark what is established vs what is a conjecture.

§N+1 Numerical results
   — Exact computed values, what method was used, what was validated.

§N+2 Open problems
   — Ranked list. "Item 1 is the next thing to prove."
```

## Sync discipline

The condensed document and the main document will drift apart unless you
actively sync them. Two situations require a sync:

1. **New result established:** After adding a theorem or corrected formula to
   the main document, add the statement (not the proof) to the condensed document.

2. **Correction:** If you find that something in the condensed document is wrong,
   fix it immediately. A wrong condensed document is worse than no condensed
   document — Claude will confidently work from incorrect information.

The `/sync-condensed` skill automates part of this: it identifies which changes
in the main document are "load-bearing" (new theorems, corrected formulas) and
prompts you to propagate them.

## What NOT to do

**Don't let it grow.** The whole point is that it's short. When it exceeds
~30 pages, prune it: move historical context to the main document, collapse
routine results into a single table, remove anything that is not load-bearing.

**Don't put in-progress work in it.** The condensed document contains what
is established. If you're in the middle of a calculation, that goes in
next-session-prompts, not here.

**Don't stop maintaining it.** A condensed document that is 3 months out of
date is useless. Treat syncing it as part of the cost of every new result.

## Example entry

Bad (too much context, wrong level of detail):

> In §7 of main.tex, after a lengthy computation involving the functional equation
> of ξ(s) applied three times and a symmetrization over the Weyl group, we found
> that the residue of M_3 at the boundary hyperplane μ_0 = 1 equals...

Good (self-contained, exact, no derivation):

> **Theorem (boundary residue).**
> Res_{μ_0=1} M_3(μ_0, μ_1, μ_2, μ_3) = ½ Z(μ_1, μ_2, μ_3),
> where Z is the Zagier triple product (eq. Zagier3eisen).
> Analogously at all four boundary hyperplanes {μ_i = 1} and {μ_i = 0}.
> Proved: Thm 1 = Thm 2 comparison, main.tex sec:boundaryStructure.
> Status: ESTABLISHED.
